# Kotlin Basics

This project just has simple explanatory examples and illustrative test code, it is not intended to replace the official docs in any way.

## Official Docs

The official Kotlin documentation is very good.

https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html

### Start with the By Example Pages

The Kotlin By Example section is probably the easiest way to get started with Kotlin.

https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/overview

The benefit of the By Example pages is that you can change the code on the page and run it online. Using it as a simple playground for experimentation.

### Use the Basic Syntax and Idioms as a Quick Reference Refresher

The official 'Basic Syntax' and 'Idioms' pages are very good simple reference guides (once you've used the language):

- https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-syntax.html
- https://kotlinlang.org/docs/idioms.html

The Basic Syntax can be a little confusing if you are new to the language because it introduces concepts without any explanation while demonstrating other concepts.
